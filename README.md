## Usage

### Basic Operations
- **Add Todo**: Type in the input field and press Enter or click "Add Task"
- **Complete Todo**: Click the "Complete" button or press Enter/Space when focused
- **Delete Todo**: Click the "Delete" button or press Delete/Backspace when focused
- **Reorder**: Drag todos to new positions or use Ctrl+Arrow keys

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl + /` - Focus input field
- `Ctrl + L` - Focus first todo item
- `Arrow Up/Down` - Navigate between todos
- `Home/End` - Jump to first/last todo
- `Enter/Space` - Toggle completion status
- `Delete/Backspace` - Delete todo
- `Ctrl + Arrow Up/Down` - Move todo up/down

### Dark Mode
Click the moon/sun icon in the top-right corner to toggle dark mode. The app respects your system's dark mode preference by default.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Input Validation**: All user input is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
2. **State Management**: Todos stored in memory array, synced with localStorage
3. **Rendering**: DOM updates triggered by state changes
4. **Persistence**: Automatic saving to localStorage with error handling

### Storage Strategy
- Primary: localStorage for persistent storage
- Fallback: In-memory storage when localStorage unavailable
- Validation: All stored data validated and sanitized on load
- Error Recovery: Corrupted data automatically cleaned or reset

### Security Features
- HTML tag stripping from user input
- Control character removal
- Duplicate prevention
- Input length validation
- Safe DOM manipulation (textContent over innerHTML)

## Development

### Code Style
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility-first approach

### Key Functions
- `loadTodos()` - Safe data loading with validation
- `validateTodo()` - Input sanitization and validation
- `renderTodos()` - DOM rendering with accessibility
- `saveTodos()` - Error-handling storage operations
